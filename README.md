# Smart-plant-monitoring-system
IOT based watering system for fields.
Sensors will check the moisture, temperature and humidity of soil.
It will all be done electronically on devices.
soil moisture sensor , node MCU , DHT11, relay module , motor pump components used in this system.
With the help of and IOT based app BLYNK we will set the parameters and check the moisture, temp, humidity of soil and with node MCU controller it will allow the app to allow the motor pump to run waters in fields
